            "description": "The video, which portrays a contemporary depiction of heaven, was directed by Saad Moosajee and produced by the Brooklyn-based creative studio, Pomp&Clout. <br><br> Aesthetically, the video resembles a Renaissance painting come to life with a modern twist. While the video is in fact fully animated, it at times tricks the eye making the viewer question if it was shot practically. <br><br>I choreographed and performed the movement of every character in the video. The figures were then sequenced amongst hundreds of digital lights by animators Zuheng Yin and Chanyu Chen."
