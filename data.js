While the video is in fact fully animated, it at times tricks the eye making the viewer question if it was shot practically. <br><br>I choreographed and performed the movement of every character in the video. The figures were then sequenced amongst hundreds of digital lights by animators Zuheng Yin and Chanyu Chen."
