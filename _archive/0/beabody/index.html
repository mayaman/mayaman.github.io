    <div class="description">
      <p>This project grew out of my love for three things: music, dance, and software. Throughout my media studies education, discussions have often caused me to question how people and specifically modern day technology can exist in harmony rather than in conflict. Given my appreciation for music visualization and dancing, this idea led me to consider how a computerâ€™s way of visualizing music involves graphics while dancing can also be considered an example of music visualization but via the human form.</p>

      <p>This work focuses on three main bodies of theory: visualization, the computer as a medium, and disembodiment. By applying these concepts to music visualization done by both a person and a program, this piece investigates the connection between people and technology and aims to demonstrate how humans and computers can coexit in cooperation.
      </p>

      <p>This piece was designed, danced, and developed by me.</p>
