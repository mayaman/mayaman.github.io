      <p>Working on the Experience Centers team at Google, another Engineering Practicum intern and I were given the task of creating an exhibit in the Holodeck space at the Google Partner Plex that somehow used the kinect sensors on the walls and the Youtube API. Using the design thinking process to brainstorm, we decided to create this immersive music visualization experience that shows off Youtube and Google's technology.</p>
      <p>I worked on the front end of the exhibit, using Firebase as the persistent database, node.js as server side Javascript, p5.js for the visualizations and sound analysis, and the Youtube API to access the top trending music videos in specified regions. A user first walks in and stands on one of the circles on the floor, say Brazil's. The kinect cameras use depth sensing to detect that a person is on that circle and tells the wall's computer to cue one of the currently top trending music videos in Brazil and to display the music visualization specified for that location. </p>
      <p>The exhibit is configurable: users can type in up to six countries of their choosing and see the whole exhibit change based around those regions' data. Also, the color palette of each music visualization is chosen based on the dominant colors used in the video's thumbnail. This way, each visualization's aestheic matches that of the music video it's surrounding.</p>

      <p>A typography assignment for my 2D Design class. We were prompted to represent a four letter word in the physical realm and create it using materials relating in some way to the word's denotation. Though asked to photograph our work, I requested to produce a video instead, for I wanted to focus on the word move.</p>
      <p>With the help of two dancers wearing all black, I recreated each letter of the word using the shapes of their bodies and filmed a short video clip of them against a white wall. After putting each clip side by side, I filtered the videos using openCV’s in range feature so that the pixels making up the dancers’ bodies became white and the background became black. This piece is meant to bring the word “move” to life and demonstrate that font can come in all forms.</p>

    <h1>Socially Active: The Media Machine</h1>
    <hr class="primary">
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/147912975?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="750" height="422" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <div class="description">
      <p>Social media is many things: a gallery of glossy images, a platform to share, an opportunity to connect and communicate … but, what it is not is real life. Yes, it may demonstrate aspects of reality, yet this two dimensional world does not equate to the real world. And unfortunately, this distinction is not often acknowledged.
      </p>
      <p>
        This piece highlights the toxicity of social media. The photos that flash across the screen were taken from the instagram profiles with some of the top number of followers. These are the photos that are reaching the largest audience within the community. The machine watches you, showing you attractive images and inviting you to “come in”. If you come close enough, it opens up to reveal yourself contained in a layout similar to all of the images you just saw. This juxtaposition emphasizes the unrealistic beauty standards many feel compelled to aspire to. The real time capture of you in that moment, living your real life, looks nothing like the carefully constructed photos that filled the screen just moments ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you enter the machine’s world, it gradually becomes apparent that the machine rewards your movement with “likes” tallied at the bottom of the screen. A play on the phrase “social media activity,” here, the more physically active you are for the camera, the more likes you acquire. This parallels the way activity is regarded on social media platforms: the more you post, comment, like, follow, etc., the more feedback you receive.
      </p>
      <p>
        That concept also drives the comment wheel behind the computer screen. It spins more and more the longer you choose to stay engaged with the machine and continue to increase your likes. The four comments rotating are real and quite common quotes found on countless photos: “you’re perfect ☹”, “how are you so pretty?”, “can I be you?”, “#goals”. These comments are not only rewarding to the person who posted the photo, but also self-deprecating of the person making that comment. This perpetuates a vicious cycle of building others up while breaking oneself down. It demonstrates the jealousy, dissatisfaction, and insecurity that social media activity often promotes. The comments framing the machine represent similar sentiments. Little prizes for your engagement and proof of existence in this two dimensional world.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this piece, I intend shed light on one facet of social media that I believe influences many people today. I do not believe social media is all bad. There are clearly great benefits to such technology and human interaction. Yet, while appreciating the positive, it is important to also consider the negative. We must exist outside of our screens. We must actively cultivate the ability to think outside of our screens. Sure, we can choose to “come in”, but we must also be able to choose to leave.</p>

      <h1>Water You Eating?</h1>
      <hr class="primary">
      <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/148695874?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="750" height="422" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <div class="description">
        <p>For the past couple of years, I have been extremely interested in food politics and its relation to sustainability. After researching environmental, ethical, and health statistics related to eating, I was inspired to go vegan and cut out animal products from my life in hopes of promoting a healthier planet. I have often found it difficult to discuss these issues without others because many may feel uncomfortable or even offended, so I was quite excited to have the opportunity to express the severity of food's impact on our planet through this final project on water.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this piece, my partner Colin & I intended to convey a fact surprisingly unknown to many: the production of many commonly eaten foods, such as beef, chicken, and milk, requires a ridiculous amount of water. We chose to create a data visualization using plastic water bottles. Not only do the bottles represent a commonly known amount of water, but this was also an important theme that we covered in class. After playing with ideas of scrolling, appearing, etc. we eventually decided that showing the bottles falling from the sky would be the most effective graphic. As an additional reference, we added a to scale image of a person standing next to a water bottle. As the animation plays, the water bottle grows to represent, in relation to the human standing to its side, the volume of water necessary to produce a certain food. The juxtaposition of these two visualizations aims to demonstrate to our audience the great consequence of their choices, especially here in California considering the drought.
        </p>
        <p>
          The physical aspect of our piece is meant to connect these facts and this concept to one's reality. Four plates of "food" rest on four red solo cups (again, the bringing back the plastic motif). Distance sensors powered by an arduino detect if a plate was chosen and tell the program (written in Processing) the corresponding sound file and number of bottles to use. We structured it so that every person must pick up a plate in order to trigger the visualization. We hope that the performance of this action creates a muscle to mind connection that causes people to think about our piece the next time they reach for their food.</p>

            Created with my team at the Claremont Colleges bi-annual 5C Hackathon, Heart (Hear Art) aims to make music accessible and enjoyable for both the deaf/hard of hearing and hearing communities together. We used the Spotify web API to access their music library and p5.js to make the visualizations. Anyone can simply log in with their spotify account or facebook, search a song, then watch, listen, and jam. In the future, we'd love to make this an open source project and build out a library of visualizations collected from artists and technologists all over the world.

        <div class="description">
          <p>I built this machine to simulate the practice of plucking petals off of a flower while reciting “he loves me, he loves me not” (but I chose to use “they” for gender inclusivity). Normally, this couplet is repeated until all of the petals are dropped, and whichever statement spoken as the last petal is plucked is deemed true. In this work, I chose to infinitely oscillate between both statements, thus representing many peoples’ train of thought as they pursue love: round and round in their own head going crazy trying to figure out someone else’s true feelings. But, love is a natural human emotion, and such sentiment cannot be captured nor defined by a logical program. This rendition of an old game emphasizes the foolishness of the petal plucking and the daftness of the mind. Yet, this machine’s performance evokes a serious feeling of familiarity for any that have been caught endlessly wondering if their feelings are shared.</p>

            Inspired by recent episodes of police brutality, the Black Lives Matter movement, and more specifically, the "Hands Up Don't Shoot" slogan adopted by protestors responding to to the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
          </p>
          <p>
            This game like interaction forces the user to take on a very commonly played persona in video games today: the one with a gun. But here, rather than shooting back or attempting to defend itself, the target simply raises its hands up when the weapon is aimed at it. This moment is crucial, for it causes the "player" to consider their next move. Many people will be curious and click the mouse, causing the gun to fire and the game to end.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope this piece sparks some reflection and contemplation of the role that guns, games, and power dynamics play in real life interactions both very recently and further in the past.

            Featured in the exhibit: "Life After the Great Separation: Documenting California as an Island."
          </p>
          <p>
            After the Great Separation, California’s unique culture evolved in many ways as this new republic cut old ties with the U.S.A. Social media continued to heavily influence this society as the number of social media users in California was constantly on the rise. The trending hashtags that surfaced within this community were symbolic of various aspects of this new nation. This piece showcases a curated collection of the top tagged words and phrases on various online platforms beginning from the beginning: 0 P.S. (Post-Separation). By watching which hashtags appear over time, viewers are able to get a sense of what this self-governed island was like in the days, weeks, and months following the phenomenal secession: How did people react to the Separation? What did the community value? How did these Californians live their lives?
          </p>
          <p>
            Watch each tag rise and fall from popularity as time passes and California becomes a world unto itself.
